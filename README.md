   # ![3. Jabar's Water Source Data Analysis](https://github.com/boxside/Jabar-s_Water_Source)
 
 
  ![water](https://github.com/boxside/Jabar-s_Water_Source/blob/main/figure/Figure_3.png)
 
 
  * Data Exploration and visualization using dataset from Jabar Open Data
  * Visualize the amount of water source in the city/district based on condition
  * To get the city/district has the most water source
  * To get the city/district has the most water source that had seriously damaged condition
  * Visualize with geomapping,data of water source avaliability based on city/distric


  
   # ![4. Jabar's Vegetable's Production Data Analysis](https://github.com/boxside/Jabar-Veggie)
 
 
  ![veggie](https://github.com/boxside/Jabar-Veggie/blob/main/figure/Untitled-3.jpg)
 
 
  * Data Exploration and visualization using dataset from Jabar Open Data
  * Give Data Insight from dataset
  * To get the city/district has the most production total
  * Built Dashboard Mapping using Tableau


   # ![5. Vidio.com Data Analysis Online Exercise](https://github.com/boxside/Vidio_Play_Data_Analysis)
 
 
  ![vidio](https://github.com/boxside/Vidio_Play_Data_Analysis/blob/main/figure/1200px-Logo_Vidio.png)
 
 
  * Data Exploration and visualization about visitor play dataset
  * Give Data Insight from dataset
  * Data storytelling from dataset
  * Clustering customer using K=modes

   # ![6. Airbnb Data Analysis](https://github.com/boxside/Airbnb_Data_Analysis)
 
 
  ![Airbnb](https://github.com/boxside/Airbnb_Data_Analysis/blob/main/output_15_0.png)
 
   # ![7. Coil Production Yield Analysis](https://github.com/boxside/coil_yield)
 
 
  ![CRC](https://github.com/boxside/coil_yield/blob/main/crc.jpg)
 
 * Cold Rolling Mill is the one of process in Steel Manufacturing, that produced Cold Rolled Coil.
 * there are 1303 Coils that acceptable to send to customer, but there are 154 coil that below threshold.
 * lower yield caused by scrap or byproduct that producted from every process line
 * 6HI Line have more production rate  66.9% and higher yield 0.906 than BLS from total coil that below threshold
 * lower yield mostly occur for coil with thickness <0.250 and width <930mm for every cold rolling mill, its result approx  0.92%
 * BLS can be optional line for distribution coil with target thickness <0.250mm to maximize time efficient up to 30%
 * mostly defect occur is edge defect that make trimming lose in finishing line higher.
